>> complexity increases cost and support requirement

>> cost and square is square of solution in use 
no of solution = 2
cost and support = 2^2 or 2x2

>>Sources of complexity
1. Application stacks--> means a operating environment
without standardization organisation can use more than one stack that could lead to complexities

2. Multiple hardware
--> can cause complexity by
i- you need to keep track of contracts and warranties of different vendors
ii- the time period between update and implimentation increases due to testing it and onfigring it on different hardwares
iii- more diverse hardware means recovery disadter
in some cases you can not standardize things due to legacy or mission critical functions

3. Identity management,
4. legislative and regulatory mandates
5. connectivity

>>complications of complxity
1. Higher personnel costs:
2. Increase cost of business continuity and disaster recovery
3. Higher software cost
4. Redundency

>>Planning for consolidation(soldifying a company or process of making it strong)
sunk cost(the cost has already been incurred and can not be recovered) should not be the sole reason of staying in existing envrionment

>>Planning, (making decisions about the future)
three stages of planning
1. strategic planning, long term executive level planning
2. tactical planning, mid term planning with affects on middle management 
3. operational planning, short term and day to day operations concering planning

Methods
1. 80/20 rule: Pareto principal
2. Finding values
